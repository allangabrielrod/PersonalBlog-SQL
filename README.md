# üíÅ Extra Tips

If you're a developer and want to make changes to this project, we recommend you to install [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) as a node global package. So you can focus on development instead of waste time restarting the application on every change. To install it just run:

<code>$ npm i -g nodemon</code>
